This toolkit has been cra ed specially for reference forby all the the stakeholders involved in the genera on, collec on, storage, transporta on, treatment & disposal of Hazardous waste. Further, it is published as a reference for ci zens , ins tu ons interested to explore and understand the key features of the rules no fied in 2016.
                        The tool kit describes Hazardous Waste Classifica on and Operatorss' Requirements, aspects of Import & Export of Hazardous & Other Wastes, Record keeping, Hazardous Waste Generator Training Requirements, Disposal of Hazardous waste. It provides useful ps, FAQs, do's and don'ts, methods and prac ces that should be followed in the Hazardous solid waste management process.

                            Sense Environmet (SE) supplies environmentally-friendly waste treatment systems for a wide range of organic industrial waste.
                            Thanks to  SE plasma systems, the waste disposal process has become fully ecological compared to current solutions on the market. In particular, we are focused on providing solutions to hazardous and toxic waste streams from industrial sources like pharmaceutical plants, refineries, paint or crop protection and many others.
                            At Sense Environment, our engineers work with our clients and thoroughly study their operations to provide the necessary support services needed to satisfy both present and future requirement for a wide range of industry needs. Our capabilities encompass everything from initial modeling, through pilot testing of waste streams, system design according to customer requirements, suppling onsite commissioning, to on-going support for full commercial plants. Our team consist of highly qualified engineers, PhD's, and technical specialists. They share their thinking, expertise and knowledge to develop the most appropriate solution for each customer.

                        <p>Sense Environment liquid waste treatment systems (SEL) operate at high temperatures to destruct solvents into water vapor and carbon dioxide. They offer high destruction efficiencies and are ideal for use with most organic waste applications.
                        Eliminating halogenated solvents such as chlorinated, fluorinated, and brominated emissions with the highest possible destruction efficiencies (greater than 99.99%) requires a unique combination of control technologies. In addition to solvent destruction, by-products of combustion - HCl, HF, and HBr - must also be removed before being exhausted to the atmosphere.
                        For difficult applications such as these, Sense Environment  has designed systems which consist of a plasma reactor matched with water quench and acid gas scrubber.
                        This system eliminates standard VOCs and are designed using HastalloyÂ® to withstand the harsh environments created by the destruction of halogenated compounds. Because of the destruction of the chlorinated compounds, HCl is formed and must be treated prior to being exhausted to the atmosphere.
